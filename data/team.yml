  bio:
    - "When Steve started writing software, it was literally put in a box and shipped out of the
    office. He’s a (reluctantly) famous indie Mac OS Developer, and has written titles such as
    <a href='http://www.finaldraft.com'>Final Draft</a>, the industry standard in screenwriting
    software, <a href='http://www.cocoatech.com/'>Path Finder</a>, the most popular OS X
    alternative file manager, as well as the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILike'>iLike</a>
    sidebar (which was bought up by MySpace in 2009). Recently he’s transitioned to writing cross-platform web
    apps as well as mobile apps. When he isn’t writing code, Steve can be found riding around San
    Francisco on his fixie, wearing ironic t-shirts, or watching some obscure youtube video you've
    never heard of. Or at home with his wife and kids."
